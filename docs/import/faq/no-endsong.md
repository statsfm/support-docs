Only the Extended streaming history data package includes the correct files to [import to stats.fm](../spotify-import), the other packages are both not eligible for importing! Sorry for the inconveniences! We're recommending to check the e-mail you've received from Spotify to download the data to ensure that you got the correct package.

You most probably have requested other packages besides the Extended streaming history package. The correct package might still be processed by Spotify though, therefore please open [this page](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/) again, login with your Spotify and check the panel 'Extended streaming history data'. If it indicates that the package is still being processed you just need to have some more patience until the correct data arrives. If you have not requested it already, tick the checkmark for the 'Extended streaming history' and hit the request data button, afterwards continue with [step 2 of the import guide](../spotify-import#2-confirm-your-request).
