# Banned

In order to keep the app trustworthy and fun for everyone, users can be banned for multiple reasons. The most common reasons are:
* Stream fraud (faking streams to become the top listener for example)
* Sending abusive chat messages
* Using abusive content as your profile picture or in your bio

## What to do when I'm banned?
If you're banned all your streams will be deleted from the platform and your account will go in lockdown mode. You won't be able to sign in anymore until you get unbanned.

If you feel as if you've been falsely banned and wish to appeal, please send a message to [support@stats.fm](mailto:support@stats.fm).

## Will I get a refund when I get banned?
As stated in [our terms of service](https://stats.fm/terms) no refunds will be issued if you get banned.
